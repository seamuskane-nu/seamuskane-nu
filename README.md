## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Music Excerpt Sampler](https://github.com/seamuskane-nu/Music-Excerpt-Sampler)
**Python | NumPy | SciPy | librosa | Digital Signal Processing**

An intelligent audio sampling tool that extracts musically-coherent excerpts using custom DSP algorithms.

**Key Achievements:**
- Implemented spectral flux onset detection from scratch (98% accuracy vs librosa)
- Built 3 sampling modes: beat-aligned, bar-based, and onset-triggered
- Designed efficient caching system with 10-20x speedup on subsequent loads
- Supports all major audio formats (WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A)

**Technical Highlights:**
- FFT-based frequency analysis with Hann windowing
- Adaptive peak detection using statistical thresholding
- Dual-algorithm architecture (custom + librosa)
- BPM detection and beat tracking


### Hierarchical Bitmap Set Manager

A memory allocation system using binary tree structures for efficient memory management.

**Key Features:**
- Binary tree-based memory allocation
- Recursive allocation/deallocation algorithms
- Boolean node tracking for free/occupied memory representation
- Enhanced clarity and efficiency over data model approach
